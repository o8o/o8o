- 📫 How to reach me: andrea.lambruschini@gmail.com
- 💞️ My passions: 

   I love meta programming, Domain Driven techniques, UML Modeling and I have written several code generators and DSL (Domain Specific Languages).
   I have spent many years of work in R&D and I am thrilled with the results achieved. 
   Destiny led me to micro programming .. everything is a beautiful journey!

   Ah .. i graduated in computer science .. and this was perhaps the origin of my passion .. i discovered a world and i will never stop living there
